                        <p>Our newcomers attend the general lessons, which are held every Saturday from 4:30-6:30pm in the CCRB mirror room. In each 2-hour lesson, our instructors generally cover three dances and they will cover the same three dances for approxamately three weeks. By the time our first major competition comes around, our newcomers will know the steps to most dances to be able to compete successfully against other schools.</p>

                        <p>To get onto our other teams (Pre-C and above), the team holds tryouts at the beginning of each academic semester (not including spring and summer) and our coaches decide who dances on what teams. To be able to try out, you and your partner must have a working knowledge of the basic steps in each of the six major International-style dances (Waltz, Tango, Quickstep, Cha-Cha, Rumba, Jive).<br />
