                        <p align="left" class="style3">Our members love to ballroom dance socially, but the other aspect of ballroom dancing that really gets us excited about practicing is the competition component. The team competes at anywhere from two to four competitions per semester, all of which are optional.</p>

                        <p align="left" class="style3">Though attending competitions is optional, we highly encourage you to compete with us as we are one of the most successful collegiate ballroom organizations in the Midwest and in the nation! We have a great program for you to learn dancing from and this has translated into success at competitions at all skill levels.</p>

                        <p align="left" class="style3">As a couple, you and your partner will compete together against other people in as many as 16 different events. When we attend competitions, you will also compete along side the rest of us to represent the University of Michigan. No matter the skill level or whether we are competing against our own friends, we are always there to cheer our team on. Sometimes we can get a bit loud and crazy at competitions, but that's part of the fun!<br>

                        </p>
