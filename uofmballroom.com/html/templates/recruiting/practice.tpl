                        <p align="left" class="style3">For those seeking a more intensive ballroom experience, the team provides venues for their members to practice in. These are at the Dance Theater Studio and The Ballroom Dance Club.</p>

                        <p align="left" class="style3">Usually at practice, we simply play music and let you and the rest of our members work with your respective dance partners or on individual technique. Some days we'll play only Latin music and other days we'll only play Standard music.</p>

                        <p align="left" class="style3">If you come to these practice sessions, feel free to ask any one of our returning members questions regarding dance moves or technique. Practice times are a great opportunity to get to know one another and provide a great atmosphere for learning as our returning members are always willing to help out!</p>

                        <p align="left" class="style3">Open dance, provided by the Ballroom Dance Club is also a great way to keep those dance moves fresh in your mind and feet. For two hours the Club plays all sorts of music for their members to dance to. This is also a great way to meet your fellow team members as well as dance with them!</p>

                        <p align="left" class="style3">Below is a sample of photos of what it is like to come to these events.</p>
